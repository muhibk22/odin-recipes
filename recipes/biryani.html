        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Add garlic, ginger, and green chilies, and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the meat and cook until browned on all sides. Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
            <li>Mix in the yogurt, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the spices are well combined with the meat.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot, stirring gently to combine with the meat and spices.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let the biryani sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with fresh cilantro, mint leaves, and fried onions before serving.</li>
